## Introduction

Sorting algorithms are fundamental to computer science and software engineering. They allow us to organize data efficiently, making it easier to search, analyze, and manipulate. This repository aims to provide clear, concise, and well-documented implementations of a wide range of sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms

The repository includes implementations of various sorting algorithms, including but not limited to:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort
- Radix Sort
- Counting Sort
- Bucket Sort

Each sorting algorithm is implemented in different programming languages, allowing you to compare and contrast the differences in syntax and performance across languages.

## Languages

Currently, sorting algorithms are implemented in the following programming languages:
- C
- Python
- C++
- Java

If you'd like to contribute implementations in other languages, feel free to do so!

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have a new sorting algorithm implementation, improvements to existing code, or translations to additional programming languages, please feel free to submit a pull request. Make sure to follow the contribution guidelines outlined in the CONTRIBUTING.md file.
